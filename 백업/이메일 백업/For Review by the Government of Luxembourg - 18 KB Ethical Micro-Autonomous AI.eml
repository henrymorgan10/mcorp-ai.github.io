The 18-KB micro-autonomous AI was completed on October 31.
NeurIPS submissions close on July 1.
If Luxembourg were invited to demonstrate this 18-KB offline self-learning
AI at NeurIPS,
it would represent a landmark moment =E2=80=94 the first ethical micro-auto=
nomous
intelligence ever presented.
In 2024, a 100-MB PyTorch demo by a high-school student received the top
Novel + Tiny award.
This 18-KB model, operating fully offline and transferring control back to
the user through ethical reasoning,
sets an unprecedented benchmark for responsible autonomy.
The live version is available at mcorpai.org for verification by the
Government of Luxembourg.
