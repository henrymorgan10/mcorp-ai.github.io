Your Excellency,

I wish to express my deepest gratitude for the time and attention you have
kindly given to my proposal.
The attached *18-KB offline artificial intelligence model* aligns closely
with the technological directions currently highlighted at *NeurIPS (Neural
Information Processing Systems)* =E2=80=94 the world=E2=80=99s leading AI c=
onference =E2=80=94
particularly within the fields of *TinyML* and *Responsible AI*.

NeurIPS annually features leading institutions such as Google, MIT, and
Stanford, and its recent award-winning demonstrations have focused on
*autonomous
learning in offline environments*, *low-power reinforcement learning*,
and *ethical
systems capable of detecting human intervention*.
For instance, one of the notable 2023 demonstrations was an *87-KB
browser-based reinforcement-learning model* that learned locally from
limited data =E2=80=94 a milestone for miniature autonomous intelligence.

In comparison, the present 18-KB model implements, within the world=E2=80=
=99s
smallest footprint, a full structure of *reinforcement learning
(reward-based adaptation), local memory retention, and ethical control that
halts autonomy immediately upon human input*.
Accordingly, it could be considered *a highly competitive candidate for the
NeurIPS Demo Track or Responsible AI Session*.

Beyond its technical novelty, the potential submission of this model
represents an opportunity for *Luxembourg=E2=80=99s vision of Trustworthy a=
nd
Human-Centric AI* to be recognized and validated at the highest level of
the global scientific community.

With my highest respect and sincere appreciation,
*Jeon Gyu-min (Morgan J.)*
